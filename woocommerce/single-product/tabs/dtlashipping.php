										<b>TURN AROUND TIME</b>
									<p>We offer a standard delivery and a rush turn around time (if available, for a fee) depending on your desired in-hands date.
To avoid any delays ensure that all artwork files, mock ups, and any special instructions are included at the start of your order to avoid having to gather any missing information.</p>
<b>SHIPPING METHODS & SPEEDS</b>
<p>We offer free local pick up as well as local courier deliveries, and shipping via UPS, Fed Ex, DHL, & USPS. Free UPS Ground shipping with orders placed online over $1,500.
Expedited shipping speeds including 2nd Day Air and Next Day Air are available for a premium on time sensitive orders.</p>

<b>READY DATE VS IN HANDS DATE</b>
<p>All of our dates listed are dates that the merchandise will either be ready for pick up or shipped out.
The ready date is the date the merchandise leaves our warehouse, and the in-hands date is the date that you will receive the packages. Based on your final shipment destination, shipping transit times need to be calculated to receive an accurate in hands date.</p>
