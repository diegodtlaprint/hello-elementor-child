											<b>COLORS & PLACEMENTS</b>
										<p>Due to the nature of decorating on various fabric blends, dye lots, as well as human involvement in the printing process there is a 3-5% tolerance in pms pantone matching as well as a 1/4" tolerance on placements of graphics in each direction. sample machines and production machines apply different pressure while printing and may result in a 3-5% tolerance on color from approved sample to bulk production.</p>
	<b>ARTWORK FILES</b>
	<p>Acceptable file formats; .psd, .ai, .pdf, .tiff, .eps, .png
Artwork should be expanded with all text converted to outlines and .psd files should be sent in 300 dpi to scale</p>
